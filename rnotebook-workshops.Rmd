In an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, you can write your ideas in the same document as your code. 

You will be coding within "code chunks" which you can create using *command + option + I*. Everything outside of these chunks are just plain text and do not affect your code. 

You can also do some *fancy* formatting of your **notebook** for emphasis. 

You can make maths happen! $1+1=2$ 

You can also make tables in text, but I find this confusing.

You might find this [cheatsheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rmarkdown-1.pdf) useful for helping you format your notebook.

The main advantages of rmarkdown is that it can: 

* help you adopt literate programming, where code is more friendly to a human rather than a computer
* make it easier to keep track of changes
* export your code for sharing 
* publish your code in many formats.

The format of this notebook will be:

0. Setting up your r notebook
1. Creating some simple plots
2. Creating an interactive map using mapview
3. Wrap up

# 0) Setting up your r notebook
Usually there is a global setup chunk where you can establish what options you want for the entire document. This automatically runs and carries throughout your document. 

To run this document you need to make sure you have the following packages downloaded. This chunk will not be run unless you manually run lines because of "eval=FALSE"
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown", dep = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("mapview")
```

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) # this tells r to not print messages for all of our subsequent chunks. This can be handy for very annoying packages that have loading messages

# set up directory if not using github/project

#load all the libraries that you use a lot
library(tidyverse)
```

# 1) Creating some simple plots
When you execute your code, your results will appear beneath the code, not in the console.
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

rmarkdown is compatible with many packages like ggplot

```{r}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars,cyl=factor(cyl,ordered=TRUE,levels=c(4,6,8)))
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=5)

my_scatplot <- ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=wt,y=mpg)) + geom_point()
my_scatplot + xlab('Weight (x 1000lbs)') + ylab('Miles per Gallon') + geom_smooth()
```

# 2) Creating an interactive map using mapview
Notebook is also compatible with interactive plots! Wow how amazing.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(gapminder)

p <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year==1977) %>%
  ggplot( aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(p)

```



And it renders maps as well!
```{r}
#loading libraries for this chunk
library(mapview)
mapview(breweries)

```

# 3) Wrap up
As you can see, r notebooks can be an amazing and fabulous tool!

I would though be careful if you are working with fine scale mapping tools e.g. shape files can take a very very long time to render.

After you have finished writing your document. You can click run all code to have everything compiled. You can also select preview to see what your file looks like.

What you will notice after you have saved and compiled everything is that there is a little html file produced! This is your shareable report :)

How good is that??
