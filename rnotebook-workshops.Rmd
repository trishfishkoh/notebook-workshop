In an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook, you can write your ideas in the same document as your code. 

You will be coding within "code chunks" which you can create using *command + option + I*. Everything outside of these chunks are just plain text and do not affect your code. 

You can also do some *fancy* formatting of your **notebook** for emphasis. 

You can make maths happen! $1+1=2$ 

You can also make tables in text, but I find this confusing.

You might find this [cheatsheet](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rmarkdown-1.pdf) useful for helping you format your notebook.

The main advantages of rmarkdown is that it can: 

* help you adopt literate programming, where code is more friendly to a human rather than a computer
* export your code for sharing 
* publish your code in many formats.

The format of this notebook will be:

0. Setting up your r notebook
1. Creating some simple plots
2. Creating an interactive map using mapview
3. Creating a dashboard
4. Making a presentation

# 0) Setting up your r notebook
Usually there is a global setup chunk where you can establish what options you want for the entire document. This automatically runs and carries throughout your document. 

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE) # this tells r to not print messages for all of our subsequent chunks. This can be handy for very annoying packages that have loading messages

# set up directory if not using github/project

#load all the libraries that you use a lot
library(tidyverse)
```

# 1) Creating some simple plots
When you execute your code, your results will appear beneath the code, not in the console.
```{r}
plot(cars)
```

rmarkdown is compatible with many packages like ggplot

```{r}
mtcars <- mutate(mtcars,cyl=factor(cyl,ordered=TRUE,levels=c(4,6,8)))
ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=5)

my_scatplot <- ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=wt,y=mpg)) + geom_point()
my_scatplot + xlab('Weight (x 1000lbs)') + ylab('Miles per Gallon') + geom_smooth()
```

# 2) Creating an interactive map using mapview
